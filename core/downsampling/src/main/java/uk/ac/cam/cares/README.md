# Downsampling
## When to downsample a dataset
- Reduce the size of data to prevent memory occupation of database.
- Duplicated data within short time interval that takes up space but produces no value. This increases the query response time as large dataset will take longer time to response.

## Areas of consideration
1) Downsampled data should be an accurate representation of the inherent nature/characteristics of the original data 
   - Select the right choice of downsampling method
2) Purpose and preservation of information
   - For visualization of trends?
   - For statistical analysis to extract insights?
3) Outlier handling
   - Significance of outliers â€“ Should it be included or excluded?
   - Will it affect the accuracy of representation if not removed? 
4) Downsampling resolution size

# User Guide 
## Description
This class
## How to use downsampling method
``` 
Aggregation (TimeSeries ts, Long resolution, int type)
```
`ts` is the raw timeseries data that will be downsampled.

`resolution` is the time interval in number of seconds that will be downsampled. `resolution` is in Long data type. 

`type` is the type of [downsampling method](#Downsampling Type). Input the number as according to the designated number assigned to each type. 



#### Assumption
1) Downsampling aggregation follows the left edge.
- For a time interval, this downsampling will represents this time interval on the left time edge.
2) Downsampling aggregation follows the left closing.
- For a time interval, this downsampling method will close left. For example, if a data timestamp lands exactly on the edge of a time interval, it will fall under the previous/left time interval for downsampling. 

## Downsampling Type
### 1) Maximum
Retrieves the maximum value of the points within a time resolution to represent the interval. 
### 2) Median
Retrieves the median value of the points within a time resolution to represent the time interval.
### 3) Minimum
Retrieves the median value of the points within a time resolution to represent the time interval.
### 4) Sum 
Retrieves the sum value of all points within a time resolution to represent the time interval.
### 5) Average
Retrieves the average value of the points within a time resolution to represent the time interval.
### 6) Count
Retrieves the total number of all points within a time resolution to represent the time interval.
### 7) Instantaneous
Retrieves the value of the point closest to the time resolution to represent the time interval.


## Output 
A timeseries class which is down sampled. 
## Notes 
1) Ensure there is no null data in each time resolution for the time-series to be downsampled. Data cleaning will be required to post-process of nonsensical data when null data is inputted.
