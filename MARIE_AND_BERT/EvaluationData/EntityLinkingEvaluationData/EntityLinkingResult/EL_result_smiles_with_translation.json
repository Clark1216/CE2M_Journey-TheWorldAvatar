Succinate is generated in mitochondria via the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). Succinate can exit the mitochondrial matrix and function in the cytoplasm as well as the extracellular space, changing gene expression patterns, modulating epigenetic landscape or demonstrating hormone-like signaling.[6] As such, succinate links cellular metabolism, especially ATP formation, to the regulation of cellular function. Dysregulation of succinate synthesis, and therefore ATP synthesis, happens in some genetic mitochondrial diseases, such as Leigh syndrome, and Melas syndrome, and degradation can lead to pathological conditions, such as malignant transformation, inflammation and tissue injury.[6][7][8]"], "context_left": ["Why doesn't"], "context_right": ["melt if you leave it out in the open"]}, "correct": false}, {"question": {"id": 38, "mentions": ["C1=CC=C(C=C1)COC(=O)C2=CC=CC=C2"], "label_id": [2345], "text": "What word or two-word phrase describes the shape of the C1=CC=C(C=C1)COC(=O)C2=CC=CC=C2 molecule", "entity": ["C1=CC=C(C=C1)COC(=O)C2=CC=CC=C2"], "label": [""], "context_left": ["What word or two-word phrase describes the shape of the"], "context_right": ["molecule"]}, "correct": false}, {"question": {"id": 39, "mentions": ["CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O"], "label_id": [2244], "text": "What are the isomers of CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O", "entity": ["CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O"], "label": ["Aspirin, also known as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is a medication used to reduce pain, fever, or inflammation.[5] Specific inflammatory conditions which aspirin is used to treat include Kawasaki disease, pericarditis, and rheumatic fever.[5]"], "context_left": ["What are the isomers of"], "context_right": [""]}, "correct": false}, {"question": {"id": 40, "mentions": ["CN(C)C1=CC=CC=C1"], "label_id": [949], "text": "How do we represent CN(C)C1=CC=CC=C1", "entity": ["CN(C)C1=CC=CC=C1"], "label": ["N,N-Dimethylaniline (DMA) is an organic chemical compound, a substituted derivative of aniline.
