1. Create a virtual environment in the project folder, install packages from the requirements.


2. Activate the environment, try the following command (replace the path "/home/zxc/Desktop/JPS_Chatbot/chatbot/" to the path of the virtual environment in the project folder ):

 /home/zxc/Desktop/JPS_Chatbot/chatbot/bin/gunicorn --config gunicorn_config.py -k geventwebsocket.gunicorn.workers.GeventWebSocketWorker -w 1 --timeout 120 --bind 127.0.0.1:5000 UI.source.wsgi:app

3. Visit 127.0.0.1:5000, test it out. If it works, Ctrl-C and quit it.

4. In directory "/etc/systemd/system", create file chatbot.service based on sample.service in the git. replace user name and all the paths (e.g. "/home/zxc/Desktop").

5. sudo systemctl start chatbot.service
sudo systemctl enable chatbot.service
sudo systemctl status chatbot.service

At this point, 127.0.0.1:5000 should again give you the website 

6. Then if it works, configure apache as proxy. This is the step that I am really not sure about. I assure it should provide a mapping between "kg.cmclinnovations.com/" and "127.0.0.1:5000"
