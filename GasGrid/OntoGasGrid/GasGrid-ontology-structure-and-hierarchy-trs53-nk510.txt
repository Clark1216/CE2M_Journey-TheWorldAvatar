Comments:
   - Gas Network System IRI: "http://www.theworldavatar.com/ontology/ontogasgrid/gas_network_system.owl"
   - Gas network is a heath of gas grid system and we start modeling ontology from this point.
   - In this phase of development we use OntoCape ontology, i.e we borrow IRIs from OntoCape and we did not import whole OntoCape ontology.

To model GasNetwork ontology we reuse topology ontology and system_network ontology from the JPS. That ontology is component of OntoCape.

- http://theworldavatar.com/ontology/meta_model/topology/topology.owl

This ontology imports the following ontologies:

- <owl:imports rdf:resource="http://www.theworldavatar.com/ontology/meta_model/mereology/mereology.owl"/>

   - impots: <owl:imports rdf:resource="http://www.theworldavatar.com/ontology/meta_model/fundamental_concepts/fundamental_concepts.owl"/>
         - Comment: 
		    - Classes that we are reusing from OntoCape do not have OntoCape IRIs, such as: http://www.theworldavatar.com/ontology/meta_model/fundamental_concepts/fundamental_concepts.owl#FeatureSpace
		      See page 62 in the book [1]. This is probably because of resolvability of IRIs. 
            
			- The ontology fundamental_concepts.owl is consistent (checked using HermiT reasoner).
			
- Comment: Mereology ontology is on the top of OntoCape structure hiearchy.  			

The gas_network_system.owl is implementation of GasNetwork model. In order to model gas_netwok_system.owl,  gas_network_system.owl imports from the OntoCape the following ontologies:

    1. topology ontology with base IRI:  http://theworldavatar.com/ontology/meta_model/topology/topology.owl
	2. network system ontology with base IRI: http://theworldavatar.com/ontology/ontocape/upper_level/network_system.owl
	3. technical system ontology: "http://theworldavatar.com/ontology/ontocape/upper_level/technical_system.owl"
	
		<!-- Ontologies below are imported manually because tboxgenerator tool does not suport importing ontologies automatically. -->
		<owl:imports rdf:resource="http://theworldavatar.com/ontology/meta_model/topology/topology.owl"/>
	    <owl:imports rdf:resource="http://theworldavatar.com/ontology/ontocape/upper_level/network_system.owl"/>
	    <owl:imports rdf:resource="http://theworldavatar.com/ontology/ontocape/upper_level/technical_system.owl"/>

	NOTE: In OntoCape System ontology imports network system ontology and meta model ontology. 
	We did not  follow this approach because meta model ontology imports not only topoly. 
	It imports other ontologies from the meta model that we do not need them.

	NOTE: GasNetwork system and GasNetworkSystem relaization are using object property hasRealizationAspect to model phisical gas network. 
	It is not modeling apstraction, hense specific realization aspect of phisical system.

- Monday, 2021/02/01: We need to add Tbox concept expression in LaTex for GasNetwork Ontology. We have to add only extensions of OntoCape. 

			

				   
		   
		   
		   
  
  
  
  
  - Geographical regions ontology to represent very specific geographical regions
       - borrow some ontology for Geo regions
  - some others ontologies
        - GridComponent ontology
        - GridPipeLine (Data pipe pline for Grid pipe pline) ontology
