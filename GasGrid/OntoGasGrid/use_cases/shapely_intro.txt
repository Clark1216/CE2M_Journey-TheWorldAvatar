Shapely is a Python package for set-theoretic analysis and manipulation of planar features using (via Python’s ctypes module) functions from the well known and widely deployed GEOS library. GEOS, a port of the Java Topology Suite (JTS), is the geometry engine of the PostGIS spatial extension for the PostgreSQL RDBMS. The designs of JTS and GEOS are largely guided by the Open Geospatial Consortium’s Simple Features Access Specification 1 and Shapely adheres mainly to the same set of standard classes and operations. Shapely is thereby deeply rooted in the conventions of the geographic information systems (GIS) world, but aspires to be equally useful to programmers working on non-conventional problems.

The first premise of Shapely is that Python programmers should be able to perform PostGIS type geometry operations outside of an RDBMS. Not all geographic data originate or reside in a RDBMS or are best processed using SQL. We can load data into a spatial RDBMS to do work, but if there’s no mandate to manage (the “M” in “RDBMS”) the data over time in the database we’re using the wrong tool for the job. The second premise is that the persistence, serialization, and map projection of features are significant, but orthogonal problems. You may not need a hundred GIS format readers and writers or the multitude of State Plane projections, and Shapely doesn’t burden you with them. The third premise is that Python idioms trump GIS (or Java, in this case, since the GEOS library is derived from JTS, a Java project) idioms.

If you enjoy and profit from idiomatic Python, appreciate packages that do one thing well, and agree that a spatially enabled RDBMS is often enough the wrong tool for your computational geometry job, Shapely might be for you.
