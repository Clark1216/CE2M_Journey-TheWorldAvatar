# Welcome one and all
- This is the folder that contains the work I (Tom Savage [trs53]) performed during my MPhil. 
- It can be found in preprint 279, as well as another preprint yet to be published regarding heat pumps and inequality, it will be in the 280s I suspect.

There are 5 main aspects of this folder (not including data, which can be found in Vienna)

1. ```FuelPoverty```: contains everything to do with the addition of fuel poverty data to the knowledge graph.
2. ```HadUKGrid```: contains everything to do with the addition of HadUK-Grid climate data to the knowledge graph.
3. ```OntoGasGrid```: contains everything to do with the instantiation of the UK gas grid, continuous addition of dynamic data, instantiation of consumption statistics, as well as some use cases which never really got used.
4. ```OtherTools```: nothing interesting is in this folder and I would ideally delete some of the stuff in it, the ```/Mapping and Location Tools``` part is however important for visualisation on the website I believe.
5. ```Use Case```: contains the code for calculating and saving figures for the heat pump preprint/paper (hopefully in EES). To run it properly you'll need the shapefile of the UK which can be found in the project folder in Vienna (named something like ```heat-pumps-fuel-poverty```). For a more detailed explanation on how to reproduce these figures continue to the ```README.md``` file contained therein.
