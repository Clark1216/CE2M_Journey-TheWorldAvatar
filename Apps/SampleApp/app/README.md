- Contains 
  - The single activity that host feature fragments. 
  - Application
- Any configuration layout need to be set as application level or activity level should be done in this module
  - eg. displaying content from edge to edge behind status bar and system navigation bar
  - eg. setting global top app bar
    - But this is not configure in this sample app, because it is recommended to configure the app bar in each feature if they are different
  - provide application level and activity level context
    - though the application level context is mainly handled by the dependency injection with Hilt
    - activity level context is usually used if want ViewModel persists even after the fragment ends
- It have visibility to all the navigation graph and host the nav graph.
- Top level in the dependency graph
  - No other module can depend on app. Otherwise will cause circular dependency and not able to be computed
