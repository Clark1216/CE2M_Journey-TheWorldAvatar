## Description
This `Resulted (Energy) Consumption Calculation` agent is designed to calculate the resulted electricity and gas consumption based on current energy consumptions, COP, with several assumptions and indecies, and instantiated in the [The World Avatar] KG according to the [OntoRegionalAnalysis] ontology. Details can be found in the [home page] of this agent. 

The agent is implemented as Docker container to be deployed to a Docker stack spun up by the [Stack Manager]. It is recommended to use `VS Code` to develop/deploy the agent. Hence, a few of the details below are VS Code specific.

This agent uses Derived Infomation Framework, details provided below:

### Required datasets
The required data comprimise the electricity consumption, gas consumption and COP data of the Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) in the UK . All data are updated annually. 
```bash
COP: # Available in the blazegraph, and can be calculated and instantiated by the [CopCalculationAgent]

Electricity consumption: # Available in the Ontop, a consumption csv file and config file, along with ontop.obda mapping file should be provided to enable the SPARQL query searching in the ontop. TODO: Details to be followed

Gas consumption: # Available in the Ontop, a consumption csv file and config file, along with ontop.obda mapping file should be provided to enable the SPARQL query searching in the ontop. TODO: Details to be followed
```
### Agent Setup

Before building and deploying the Docker image, several key properties need to be set in the [Docker compose file] (further details and defaults are provided in the file). For details on the [Derivation Agent configuration] please refer to the official documentation.

```bash
# Stack & Stack Clients configuration
STACK_NAME                    # Name of stack to which agent shall be deployed
DATABASE                      # PostGIS/PostgreSQL database name (default: `postgres`)
NAMESPACE                     # Blazegraph namespace (within Stack) to monitor
# Derivation Agent configuration
ONTOAGENT_SERVICE_IRI         # IRI of OntoAgent service
ONTOAGENT_OPERATION_HTTP_URL  # Port needs to match port specified in `docker-compose.yml`
DERIVATION_INSTANCE_BASE_URL  # Base IRI of all instanced generated by agent
REGISTER_AGENT                # Boolean flag whether to register agent in KG (`true` required to detect derivations)
# --- Index / Assumptions Space --- #
ELECTRICITY_CONSUMPTION_PROFILE # A list containing 12 data represents the consumption value from Jan to Dec
GAS_CONSUMPTION_PROFILE       # A list containing 12 data represents the consumption value from Jan to Dec
COP_VAR                       # Select the variable of COP to use: Max / Mean / Min
UPTAKE                        # Assumed uptake of the heat pump in the hypothesis
PROPORTION_OF_HEATING         # Assumed proportion of the gas being used for heating
BOILER_EFFICIENCY             # Assumed the efficiency of the gas boiler
```


### How to deploy this agent on stack
Details about the routes on the stack establishment, and how to deploy the agent on the stack can be found [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/blob/dev-heat-pump-migration-to-stack-2/Agents/LSOAInputAgent/deploy_agent_on_stack.html)

### Use the agent
The Resulted Consumption Calculation Agent is intended to use the `Asychronous mode` of the Derivation Framework to detect changes in instantiated [OntoRegionalAnalysis] properties (i.e. `COP`, `Electricity consumption`, `Gas Consumption`,`Boiler Efficiency`,`Proportion of Heating`,`Heat Pump Uptake`,`Energy Consumption Profile`.) and automatically updates associated `Resulted Energy Consumption`  instances in the KG. As the agent adopts the `pyderivationagent`, it also serves HTTP requests to handle synchronous derivations. However, it is (strongly) discouraged to invoke such HTTP request by ONESELF. 

After successful agent start-up, an instructional page shall become available at the root (i.e. `/`) of the port specified in the [docker compose file]. The exact address depends on where the agent container is deployed (i.e. localhost, remote VM, ...), but takes a form like `http://localhost:5200/`

## Asynchronous derivation operation
Once the Agent is deployed, it periodically (defined by `DERIVATION_PERIODIC_TIMESCALE`) checks the derivation that `isDerivedUsing` itself (parameter `ONTOAGENT_SERVICE_IRI`) and acts based on the status associated with that derivation. Although the [Derivation Agent] suggests the use of `.env` files to specify environment variables for agent configurations, this approach does not work properly with Docker stacks, i.e. `docker stack deploy`. Hence, the agent configuration is moved into the [docker compose file] instead.

Details about how to use the agent please see the [home page] of this agent
## Prior derivation markup

For the Agent to detect outdated information, a proper mark up of the relevant derivation inputs (i.e. *pure* inputs) is required. (Please note, that another pre-requisite for detecting derivation inputs is the registration of the agent in the KG, i.e. `REGISTER_AGENT=true` in the [docker compose file].) The [markup.py] example from the `pyderivationagent` package shall be used to mark up derivation inputs within the KG (for illustration purposes only)
