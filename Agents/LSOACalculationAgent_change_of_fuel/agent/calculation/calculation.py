# The purpose of this module is to define functions to calculate COP based on Temperature
# And another way around.

def delta_gas(uptake: float, total_gas_consumption, propotion_heating: float = 0.9):
    '''
    Based on a given uptake, and gas consumption, calculate how many gas will be converted to electricity, which is delta_gas
    Note: the definition of uptake is (delta_gas / gas_for_heating) = (delta_gas / (Total_gas_consumption * propotion_heating))
        Therefore, delta_gas = uptake * Total_gas_consumption * propotion_heating
        propotion_heating is hypothesd as constant, which have default value as 0.9 I suggest to check if that default value is 
        up to date or if that hypothesis is valid in your case
    '''
    delta_gas = uptake * total_gas_consumption * propotion_heating

    return delta_gas

def delta_elec(delta_gas, COP, boiler_efficiency: float = 0.8):
    '''
    Based on given COP, delta_gas to calculate how much electricity has been converted based on delta_gas
    Note: delta_elec = boiler_efficiency * delta_gas / COP. where boiler_efficiency is hypothesd as constant, 
    which have default value as 0.8. I suggest to check if that default value 
    is up to date or if that hypothesis is valid in your case
