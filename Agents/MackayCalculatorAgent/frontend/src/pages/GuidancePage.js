                The Singapore MacKay Carbon Calculator is inspired by the UK MacKay Carbon Calculator, that will allow Singapore to explore pathways to decarbonization. The Singapore MacKay Carbon Calculator will closely resemble the UK version in terms of its user interface and underlying modeling approaches.</p>
               <p> The calculator is named in honour of the late Sir David MacKay who was the driving force behind the first UK 2050 calculator.

                <h2 id='secMackay'>The Singapore MacKay Carbon Calculator</h2>
                 <p>You select your level of ambition of decarbonisation effort using the levers, ranging from Level 1 - minimal effort, to Level 4 - maximum effort. Popup descriptions explain what the levels represent in terms of behavioural change or infrastructure investment.</p>
