# Description #

The `chemistry_and_robots` package provides a collection of dataclasses and SPARQL query/update functions that are used by a series of agents capable of conducting automated reaction experiments as part of [TheWorldAvatar](https://github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar) project. `chemistry_and_robots` uses `pyasyncagent>=0.0.5` to access `PySparqlClient` provided in `pyasyncagent.kg_operations` to form its SPARQL query/update utilities. For technical details, below are a few useful links:
