## Description
This `Utility Cost Calculation` agent is designed to calculate the electricity and gas cost based on [resulted energy consumptions], with electricity and gas unit cost, and instantiated in the [The World Avatar] KG according to the [OntoCAPE] and [OntoRegionalAnalysis] ontology. Details can be found in the [home page] of this agent. 

The agent is implemented as Docker container to be deployed to a Docker stack spun up by the [Stack Manager]. It is recommended to use `VS Code` to develop/deploy the agent. Hence, a few of the details below are VS Code specific.

This agent uses Derived Infomation Framework, details provided below:

### Required datasets
The required data comprimise the `resulted electricity consumption`, `resulted gas consumption`, `electricity unit cost` and `gas unit cost`. [resulted energy consumptions] agent shall be used as the upstream agent to calculate the required datasets. Upon running this agent, the result of `resulted electricity consumption`, `resulted gas consumption` shall be calculated and instantiated in the blazegrpah

### Agent Setup

Before building and deploying the Docker image, several key properties need to be set in the [Docker compose file] (further details and defaults are provided in the file). For details on the [Derivation Agent configuration] please refer to the official documentation.

```bash
# Stack & Stack Clients configuration
STACK_NAME                    # Name of stack to which agent shall be deployed
DATABASE                      # PostGIS/PostgreSQL database name (default: `postgres`)
NAMESPACE                     # Blazegraph namespace (within Stack) to monitor
# Derivation Agent configuration
ONTOAGENT_SERVICE_IRI         # IRI of OntoAgent service
ONTOAGENT_OPERATION_HTTP_URL  # Port needs to match port specified in `docker-compose.yml`
DERIVATION_INSTANCE_BASE_URL  # Base IRI of all instanced generated by agent
REGISTER_AGENT                # Boolean flag whether to register agent in KG (`true` required to detect derivations)
# --- Index / Assumptions Space --- #
ELECTRICITY_UNIT_COST         # Prices in the Unit of £/kWh
GAS_UNIT_COST                 # Prices in the Unit of £/kWh
YEAR                          # The year of the index, will be used to instantiate the indecies in the KG
```


### How to deploy this agent on stack
Details about the routes on the stack establishment, and how to deploy the agent on the stack can be found [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/blob/dev-heat-pump-migration-to-stack-3/Agents/LSOAInputAgent/deploy_agent_on_stack.html)

### Use the agent
The Utility Cost Calculation Agent is intended to use the `Asychronous mode` of the Derivation Framework to detect changes in instantiated [OntoRegionalAnalysis] properties (i.e. `Resulted Electricity consumption`, `Resulted Gas Consumption`,`Electricity Unit Cost`,`Gas Unit Cost`) and automatically updates associated `Utility Cost`  instances in the KG. As the agent adopts the `pyderivationagent`, it also serves HTTP requests to handle synchronous derivations. However, it is (strongly) discouraged to invoke such HTTP request by ONESELF. 

After successful agent start-up, an instructional page shall become available at the root (i.e. `/`) of the port specified in the [docker compose file]. The exact address depends on where the agent container is deployed (i.e. localhost, remote VM, ...), but takes a form like `http://localhost:5300/`

## Asynchronous derivation operation
Once the Agent is deployed, it periodically (defined by `DERIVATION_PERIODIC_TIMESCALE`) checks the derivation that `isDerivedUsing` itself (parameter `ONTOAGENT_SERVICE_IRI`) and acts based on the status associated with that derivation. Although the [Derivation Agent] suggests the use of `.env` files to specify environment variables for agent configurations, this approach does not work properly with Docker stacks, i.e. `docker stack deploy`. Hence, the agent configuration is moved into the [docker compose file] instead.

Details about how to use the agent please see the [home page] of this agent

## Upper level instances instatiation
If you started from an empty namespace, or have not instantiate upper level instances such as `country` or `assumption`, the result would not be able to be associated with them. Therefore it is required to run the [upper_level_ontology_update.py](./inequalityindexcalculationagent/upper_level_ontology_update.py), simply run this command in the powershell terminal:

```bash
py ./inequalityindexcalculationagent/upper_level_ontology_update.py
```
## Prior derivation markup

For the Agent to detect outdated information, a proper mark up of the relevant derivation inputs (i.e. *pure* inputs) is required. (Please note, that another pre-requisite for detecting derivation inputs is the registration of the agent in the KG, i.e. `REGISTER_AGENT=true` in the [docker compose file].) The [markup.py] example from the `pyderivationagent` package shall be used to mark up derivation inputs within the KG (for illustration purposes only), simply run this command in the powershell terminal:
```bash
py ./inequalityindexcalculationagent/markup.py
```
