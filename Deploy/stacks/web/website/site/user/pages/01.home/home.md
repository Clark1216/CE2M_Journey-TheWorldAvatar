	<p>Our Knowledge Graph (KG) services leverage advanced agent-based operation and ontology representations, thus bringing automation and semantic context to machine-assisted solutions for the problems at hand.  This allows us to introduce a semantic framework to seamlessly connect humans, machines, and agents, making them able to infer new knowledge from available data.</p>
	<p>Use the links below, or the navigation menu at the top of the page, to view interactive demos of some of our advanced agent-based services.</p>
