	<p>Our KG tools leverage advanced agent-based operation and ontology representations, thus bringing automation and semantic context to machine-assisted solutions for the problems at hand.  This allows us to introduce a platform to seamlessly connect human, machines, and agents, making them able to infer new knowledge from large sets of available data.</p>
	<p>Use the links below, or the navigation menu at the top of the page, to view interactive demos of some of our advanced agent-based tools.</p>
