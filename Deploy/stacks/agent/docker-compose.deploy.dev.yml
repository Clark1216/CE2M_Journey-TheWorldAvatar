# This configuration file should include any docker-compose options used only when deploying the
# stack WITH the '--test' flag.
# Its counterpart is docker-compose.live.yml.
#
# The expectation is that this file will contain 'ports' nodes for any services that need to map a
# host port, but other options may be valid too - please consult CMCL admins for more details.
# For guidance in setting an appropriate port number, please see the instructions at
