# Utility Images

This directory contains configurations used to set up Images that contain infrequently used utilities or act as generic bases for further Images. Images here are independent of stacks (as they can be used across any application stacks), and generally only have one version (i.e. no "dev" or "prod" modes).

Once built, images should be pushed to the Nexus server at CMCL Innovations; contact the system administrators there for more information now how to achieve this.
