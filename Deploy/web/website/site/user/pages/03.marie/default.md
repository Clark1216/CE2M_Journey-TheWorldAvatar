This website presents a proof-of-concept Question Answering system for accessing chemical data from the World Avatar knowledge graph and the Wikidata knowledge graph. The knowledge graphs offers inter-connected data from chemical kinetics to chemical and physical properties of species and many other domains. We trained a question type classification model and an entity extraction model to interpret chemistry-related questions of interest. The system has a novel design which applies a topic model to identify the question-to-ontology affiliation to improve its accuracy.
