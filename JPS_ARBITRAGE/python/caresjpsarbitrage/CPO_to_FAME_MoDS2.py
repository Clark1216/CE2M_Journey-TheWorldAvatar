# File documentation
# This file is a set of functions designed to work as an arbitrage spotter for a chemical plant converting a reagent into a product. The spotter looks through the chemical futures markets for profitable opportunities to purchase the reagent, convert it into the product and then sell the product. It factors in the costs of transport, storage and conversion and looks for the cheapest schedule. The conversion costs are based on an Aspen simulation of a relevant conversion process.
# Important assumptions include instantenaous conversion and transport, pricing other than futures is based on the literature, only marginal profit is calculated (this is liable to changes soon). 
# Additionally, it i assumed that the plant is already functioning on a long-term contract. For that reason the changes to plant's function cannot be too great and capital costs may be ignored in the calculations.
