Title: EPISODE CityChem Installation Manual.

1. Introduction: The objective of this manual is to write the precise details of
all steps for installing EPISODE CityChem on an HPC server, e.g. CSD3. This software
has dependency on seven different tools, which are being used when it runs, hence,
this manual also provides instructions on how to install them.

2. Dependency Tool Installation: In this section, we will give step-by-step instruction
to install the following tools:
	- zlib
	- szip
	- hdf5
	- netcdf-c
	- netcdf-fortran
	- proj
	- gdal
Create a folder called episode under your user home using the following command:

mkdir ${HOME}/episode

For example, for the user with the name msff2, the user home on CSD3 is /home/msff2. Following
the creation of the episode folder, the following path will be available: /home/msff2/episode.
To make all commands equally applicable on any HPC server, we will use ${HOME} instead
of any specific user.

2.7 Gdal installation
Known issue for kinetics users: you need to remove the line 'module load python/3.7/' from your bashrc and use the default option in CSD3. A copy of the bashrc file that worked can be found at JPS_CITY_CHEM\src\main\resources

Download gdal-3.0.4.tar.gz from here https://gdal.org/download.html. This 
version might be available here
https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/releases/download/v3.0.4/gdal-3.0.4.tar.gz.
After the download, put gdal-3.0.4.tar.gz under the path of episode. Go to the episode
directory (${HOME}/episode) and run the following commands.
tar -zxvf gdal-3.0.4.tar.gz
cd gdal-3.0.4/
mkdir ${HOME}/gdal
./configure --prefix=${HOME}/gdal --enable-shared CPPFLAGS="-I${HOME}/proj/include" LDFLAGS="-L${HOME}/proj/lib"
make
make install
cd $HOME
vi .bashrc

To edit the .bashrc file, press the key I, add the following export instruction as the last
line to this file.

export PATH=${HOME}/gdal/bin:$PATH

Following the addition, press the ESC key. Type colon, w and q (:wq) and press Enter.

3. EPISODE CityChem installation
Remember to logout and login again for changes to bashrc to take effect.

WARNING: Do not copy the folder from Windows to Linux to compile the code, they will have messed up line endings!
Assuming you have a folder called '~/Codes/' in your home directory, perform the following commands:
cd Codes
git clone ssh://USERNAME@vienna.cheng.cam.ac.uk/home/userspace/CoMoCommon/Codes/CARES/JParkSimulator-git
cp -r ~/Codes/JParkSimulator-git/JPS_CITY_CHEM/citychem-1.3/ ~/
cd ~/citychem-1.3/
chmod +x ~/citychem-1.3/installcc.csh

Then, execute the following commands:

./installcc.csh city example
./installcc.csh util example
cd ${HOME}/citychem-1.3/src
make â€“f Makefile.mk
cd ../SIMU
ln -s ../bin/citychem.exe

This is the end of the installation of EPISODE CityChem.

4. Run test cases
There are three test cases available to test your installation. They are saved at JPS_CITY_CHEM\src\main\resources, there is a readme file at that location with instructions on how to run the tests
