!*      EPISODE-CityChem, developed at Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht (HZG) is designed
!*      for treating complex atmospheric chemistry in urban areas (Karl, 2018). The model
!*      is an extension of the EPISODE dispersion model to enable chemistry/transport
!*      simulations of reactive pollutants on city scale. EPISODE is an Eulerian dispersion
!*      model developed at the Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU) appropriate for
!*      air quality studies at the local scale (Sl√∏rdal et al. 2003 &2008). The model is an

      SUBROUTINE STOPIT(TXTSTR)

! The subroutine writes the message in the variable TXTSTR
! to the message file, closes the message file and stops the program.

! Scalar arguments

      character(len=*), intent(in) :: TXTSTR

! Local variables

      if (fe_log) then

          CLOSE (funit_log)
      endif
      STOP 'UECT stopped! Please read the log-file!'

! End of subroutine STOPIT
