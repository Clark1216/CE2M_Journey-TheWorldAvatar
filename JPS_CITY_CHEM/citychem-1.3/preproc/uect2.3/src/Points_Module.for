!*      EPISODE-CityChem, developed at Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht (HZG) is designed
!*      for treating complex atmospheric chemistry in urban areas (Karl, 2018). The model
!*      is an extension of the EPISODE dispersion model to enable chemistry/transport
!*      simulations of reactive pollutants on city scale. EPISODE is an Eulerian dispersion
!*      model developed at the Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU) appropriate for
!*      air quality studies at the local scale (Sl√∏rdal et al. 2003 &2008). The model is an
