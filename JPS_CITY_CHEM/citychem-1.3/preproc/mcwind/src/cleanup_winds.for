!* The dispersion model EPISODE (Grønskei et. al., 1993; Larssen et al., 1994;
!* Walker et al., 1992, 1999; Slørdal et al., 2003, 2008) is an Eulerian grid model 
!* with embedded subgrid models for calculations of pollutant concentrations resulting 
!* from different types of sources (area-, line- and point sources). EPISODE solves the 
!* time dependent advection/-diffusion equation on a 3 dimensional grid. 
!* Finite difference numerical methods are applied to integrate the solution forward in time. 
!* It also includes extensions as the implementation of a simplified EMEP photochemistry 
!* scheme for urban areas (Walker et al. 2004) and a scheme for Secondary Organic Aerosol 
!* implemented by Håvard Slørdal
