Here are some folders coresponding to BMRS data querying, processing, visualisation, etc... 

The first of these "ukpowergeneration" contains the original per generation unit querying, processing (incl. KG), and visualisation. 
For information of the main files within, and visualisation, see the README(s) within. 
Within this "ukpowergeneration" folder, in the "ScriptMapQuery" folder, is the API query script, and the original DUKES <-> EIC <-> BMRS mapping script (which is partially run manually). 

There are also other query scripts. These all generally operate via CSV / Excel files (which in turn benefit from the mapping script (noted above)'s output). 
These are in the "ukopowerother" folder, and are noted in the README(s) within.
