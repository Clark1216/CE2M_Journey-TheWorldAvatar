Here are some folders corresponding to BMRS data querying, processing, visualisation, etc... 

The first of these "ukpowergeneration" contains the original per generation unit querying, processing (incl. KG), and visualisation. 
For information of the main files within, and visualisation, see the README(s) within. 
Within this "ukpowergeneration" folder, in the "ScriptMapQuery" folder, is the API query script, and the original DUKES <-> EIC <-> BMRS mapping script (which is partially run manually). 

There are also other query scripts. These all generally operate via CSV / Excel files (which in turn benefit from the mapping script (noted above)'s output). 
These are in the "ukopowerother" folder, and are noted in the README(s) within. 

In "essattatchment" are scripts related to the attachment of an ESS to a VRE site (e.g. wind). Using linear optimisation to maximise profit it charges and discharges from an ESS. 
This is also subject to further parameters for energy curtailment / export, which can work alongside the associated data inputs from "ukpowerother", which query BMRS to obtain these.
