SCRIPTS TO RUN (these both require the 'MUST COPY' instructions (below) to be completed: 
'generation_data_importer.py' is the main query script. 
'generate_visualisation_data.py' is the main visualisation script. 

TO VISUALISE: 
Look at README.md in the 'visualisaion' folder. 

MUST COPY: 
Copy to this folder all files from path: 'Dropbox (Cambridge CARES)\IRP3 CAPRICORN shared folder\_JPS Development\data\ukpowergeneration\COPY_FILES'
So 'Input-Template-Auto.csv' and 'LocalOnlyBMRSKey.txt' should both be copied to the folder level of this 'README.txt' file. 

IF YOU ARE RUNNING LOCALLY: 
You may need to import the powerplants and mapping file. 
Go here: 'Dropbox (Cambridge CARES)\IRP3 CAPRICORN shared folder\_JPS Development\data\ukpowergeneration\Local\DUKES_and_GPS'
Then follow the README there.
