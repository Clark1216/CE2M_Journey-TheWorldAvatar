With 'export_curtailment_data_importer.py' as the main script, 
these files import data from BMRS/Excels of BMRS data to input into the KG. 


EXCEL SETUP: 
This process requires excel files to be copied from: 

"\Dropbox (Cambridge CARES)\IRP3 CAPRICORN shared folder\_JPS Development\data\ukexportcurtailmentimporter\CopyExcels" into the "data" folder.

Create a folder called ScripMapQuery at the same level as the export_curtailment_data_importer.py module and 
copy the BMRS_API_Input_JA_7.py module from the path of "Dropbox (Cambridge University)\CoMo shared\ja685\BMRS\Script-BMRS-API" into it.
